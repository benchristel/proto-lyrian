# Overview of Proto-Lyrian

## What?

Lyrian is a family of [constructed languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language),
specifically [artlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) or
artistic language. The languages in the Lyrian family share descent from a common ancestor, termed
_Proto-Lyrian_.

This repository contains the grammar of Proto-Lyrian and the histories of sound change that relate
it to its descendent languages.

## Phonology

Proto-Lyrian had five vowels, represented here as **a**, **e**, **i**, **y**, and **u**.

- **A** was an open back vowel, like the _a_ in _father_.
- **E** was a mid-central or front-central vowel, like the _e_ in _pen_ or the _a_ in _cat_.
- **I** was a closed front vowel, like the _i_ in _marine_.
- **Y** was a closed central vowel, like the _e_ in _roses_.
- **U** was a back vowel, somewhere between the _o_ of _cold_ and the _u_ of _pull_.

More precise description would be misleading; the exact nature of the vowels cannot be reconstructed
with certainty.

There was a large set of consonants. The major contrasts were in voicing and glottalization.

Proto-Lyrian roots consisted of one to three (very occasionally four) syllables of consonant-vowel form.
All syllables of a root apparently had to share the same vowel. A typical root is **zadába** "place, dwelling".

Roots could have a stressed syllable with either ascending or descending pitch. In this document, the stressed syllable is marked with an accute accent (á) for ascending pitch, and a grave accent(à) for descending pitch.

## Sound change scratchpad:

- prefixing the stem vowel to augment the root (zadába -> azadába)
- vowel deletion between stops and fricatives (azadába -> azdába)
- assimilation of adjacent consonants (azdába -> azzába or addába)
- re-analysis of augmented roots as definite articles (azzába -> az-zaba)
- metathesis (azdaba -> adzaba)
- palatalization of alveolar affricates (adzaba -> ajaba)
- deletion of final low-pitch vowels
- weakening of intervocalic consonants (zadába -> zadáwa)
